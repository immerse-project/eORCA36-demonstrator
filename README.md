# eORCA36 demonstrator

This page describe the way to build the extended 1/36° global configuration (eORCA36) based on  [NEMO OGCM](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/).

This bench represents the milestone MS35 "global 1/36 configuration upgrade following" for [IMMERSE](http://immerse-ocean.eu/) H2020 project.

Compare to the the previous 1/36° global [demonstrator](https://github.com/immerse-project/ORCA36-demonstrator/), the domain has been extended southward to include the Under Ice Shelf Seas and the NEMO code has been upgraded to the [4.2 release](https://forge.nemo-ocean.eu/nemo/nemo/-/blob/4.2.0/README.rst).
